DATA EXPLORATION
Understand the characteristics of given fields in the underlying data such as variable
distributions, whether the dataset is skewed towards a certain demographic and the
data validity of the fields. 

Identify limitations surrounding the data and gather external data which may be
useful for modelling purposes. This may include bringing in ABS data at different
geographic levels and creating additional features for the model.

Exploration of interactions between different variables through correlation analysis
and look out for multicollinearity by creating interaction variables.

Furthermore, transformation of required data so that it is in an appropriate format for
analysis.
